## Insights & Lessons Learned
### Integration Challenges

Integrating the AI backend with Google's Gemini API posed significant challenges, particularly in constructing API requests using Spring Boot's webClient.post(). The process required careful attention to syntactical details, and debugging was a key part of resolving errors.

### Key Takeaways
The Gemini model provides highly accurate and relevant responses but demands precise API configuration.

Visiting Google AI Studio to generate and manage the API key is essential for successful integration.

Patience and iterative testing were crucial in overcoming integration hurdles.

### Future Enhancements
